# Installing React

~~Cried~~ Tried and Tested Methods. Simplified too.  

## Overiew

1. Install Node
2. Install React

Thats it.

### 1. Installing `node`

Go to the Nodejs website, download windows/mac version.
Install it by slamming the consecutive mindlessly untill installation is finished message pops.
If you are linux user `sudo apt install nodejs` and never mind if you are linux user you wouldnt be reading this section.

### 2. Installing `react`

go to your favorite folder and open it in powershell/terminal.

```bash
npx create-react-app ur_app_name --template typescript
```

if you are bit wild `npx create-react-app ur_app_name` for vanilla js app.

Thats it. I mean after waiting few years for completion of installation.

Well I am sucker for efficiency and optimisation.
you can keep on creating apps using that command. but after 10 apps you will wasting 3GB of data on your storage. Very Bad.  
So whats the solution. Shortcuts. yeah literally shortcuts.
