# Git Cheat Sheet

`git init` to initialise
`git status` to see status  
`git add <filename>` to add file to track  
`git commit` or `git commit -m "message"` commits: commit adds changes.  
`git branch` shows branches  
`git checkout <branchname>` changes branches  
`git merge <branchname>` merges branches with current ones  
`git rebase <branchname>` puts the branch behind the current ones linearly

## Git is kinda mind numbing

## Starting Git `init`

```git init```

### Adding to Staging Area `add`

```git add filename```

### Commiting our changes  `commit`

```git commit -m "message"```
