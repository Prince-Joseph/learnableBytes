# learnableBytes

This is where I update my Learning Jounals.

## why I do this?

I usually jot down important stuf I learn because I forget usually.
The main motive is to refresh the basics of any programming language/ framework after a long time.
This is written with a toddler's approach for logic related concepts sometimes its assumed that reader knows certain stuff (because it requires extra effort to simplify and at that time of learning I had other priorities.)

## disclaimer

The purpose is not to write a book but we never know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but to help myself or anybody with basic idea to get started with specific programming language.  

Definetely, there will be mistakes, skips in logic/ content etc...  So its unreliable as of now. [ certain areas] likely beacause i might have understood it wrong or to lazy to correct or i have missed an important piece of data.

### request

Please dont share this files, as this is just for loose reference and still juvenile for any purposes.
Rather use the references(urls) in my files which can help your or anybody you want to help.
